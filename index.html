                  Team's main focus was to find solutions to problems araising from Cisco's transition

                    As part of a team, developed and successfully deployed a global recurring
                    revenue prediction system (ATR Early Insights). Focused on designing and implementing
                    ML algorithms to detect data accuracy issues. ATR Early Insights
                    correctly identified ~400$M inaccurate renewal contracts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Implemented an iACV (incremental recurring revenue) pollution
                    detection system to proactively flag wrong methodology application and performance
                    indicators calculations.
                    The iACV alerts system led to refinement of iACV methodology and implementation of a system
                    of upstream checks and balances that significantly improved incremental revenue reporting
                    accuracy and decision making.

                    entity recognition capabilities to convert natural

                    (ex. SAP HANA, Snowflake, Teradata, etc.) through unified API; Viz Speak:
                    present query results as visualizations.

                  The self-reporting analytics system democratized data access, boosted sales teams
